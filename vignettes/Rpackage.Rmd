## Introduction

This is a package that was constructed during the Fall 2020 semester. All of the function added come from the labs. 


## Use package in Rmd 

In order to use any of the functions you will first need to call the package in the rmd file 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First using the library function
library(Rpackage)
```


## Calling a function

After attaching your package to the rmd file, to call any function from the package use the following format
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Attaching as before
library(Rpackage)
# Function format to call any function 
Rpackage::myboot(iter,x,fun,alpha)
```
